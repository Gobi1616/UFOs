## Overview of Project

### Background

The homepage and dynamic table we created throughout the module are functioning OK, but Dana (our customer) has requested that the table be filtered even further. She would like to add the ability to filter by other column headers in addition to the date filter. We're making an HTML page for this project that will allow us to use filters on the website to pull information from a javascript data file. We want to use filters because we have a lot of various sightings around the United States, and we want to categorise them depending on where they happened and what type of sighting they were.

### Objectives

The goals of this challenge are to:

- Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
- Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
- Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML

## Results

When the client first visits the website, they will see the basic opening and title with the photo at the top; as they scroll down, they will see all of the data and filters that we have available (which is in the image below). We have five distinct filters to pick from in the image below: date, city, state, nation, and shape. You can type any of these filters into the search field, and the HTML page will display all of the sightings related to that search. Multiple filters can be input at the same time to dig deeper into the data in the current search box.

## Summary

We've designed a simple website that allows the visitor to use the search bars to sort through the various sitings in our data set. One of the major drawbacks of our search bar is the inability to authenticate the actual sitings that can be better defined in the data. Knowing how many people were present at the siting would be useful in authenticating the allegations. Having as much data as possible for the website will make it the best it can be. My two suggestions for upgrading this website are: 1. more data with more information, such as the number of individuals who visited the site; and 2. more data with more information, such as the number of people who visited the site. 2. Uploading a new filter to find sitings by length, and last but not least, having a site that regularly updates our data by adding fresh sitings to our page.
